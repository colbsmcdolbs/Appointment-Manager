## Notes for my grader

The logging file is outputted to the root of the project directory. You will find it in a file called "logging.txt"

The lambda functions that I created are located in the Interfaces package, and are implemented in the file "EditCustomerViewController.java" at lines 80 and 117. Thank you for your time in grading this project. It took me a long time to make and I put in a lot of care into the styling. I hope that you like it.
